Subscription Box Service Database System  
CIS 344 – Database Systems  
Spring 2026  
Professor: Yanilda Peralta Ramos  

Project Overview  
This project represents the design and implementation of a database system for a Subscription Box Service. The system models customers, subscription plans, subscription orders, payments, and products included in each subscription box. The database was designed using Entity-Relationship modeling techniques and implemented in MySQL Workbench.

System Design Process  
The requirements for this system were gathered through research on real-world subscription box companies such as Birchbox and FabFitFun. The database was designed to support customer subscriptions, recurring payments, and product management. Chen and UML ER diagrams were created to represent the conceptual and logical data models before implementing the physical database schema.
